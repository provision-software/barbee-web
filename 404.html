If We make material changes to the Premium Services that: (a) reduce the functionality available to You on such Premium Service and (b) are mandatory (i.e., do not require You to update the BarBee Software to become effective); You may terminate Your account accordingly within ten (10) days of such modifications (as provided in Section 11.2) and receive a pro-rata refund for any amounts pre-paid, but unused for such Premium Services. We reserve the right at any time to charge fees for access to all or portions of the BarBee Services and change any such pricing at any time provided that any changes will not affect the fees for any Premium Services that You have already paid for.

PREMIUM SERVICES; PURCHASES.
Premium Services. Certain Services may be available only through creation of a User Account and payment of a fee (“Premium Services”). Through such accounts, You will have access to such Premium Services for a fixed term, which will automatically renew. The term, renewal period, and the total cost of each Premium Services offering will be provided within the BarBee Services or otherwise where the Premium Services are offered.
PREMIUM SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW.  PREMIUM SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW CONTINUOUSLY AT THE END OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, AND YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE CHARGED THE THEN-CURRENT RENEWAL PRICE (PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES) AUTOMATICALLY, WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL ACTION BY YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PREMIUM SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNLESS YOU CANCEL THEM OR WE SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
CANCELLATION POLICY.  YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR PREMIUM SERVICES AT ANY TIME, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ORDER TO CANCEL, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN IN THE BARBEE SERVICES. THERE ARE NO CANCELLATION FEES. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELLING PREMIUM SERVICES MAY BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL REQUEST TO info@barbee.app.
Trial Premiums.  Access to BarBee Premium Services may from time to time be made available on a time-limited free trial basis (a “Trial” or “Trial Premiums”). Please note that this Agreement also applies to any Trial. You may be asked to provide Your credit or debit card information when registering for a Trial. In such event, Your credit or debit card will only be charged if You do not cancel Your Trial before the end of the Trial period. If We ask for Your credit or debit card information and You do not affirmatively cancel before the end of the Trial, then Your Trial may be converted into a paid subscription and Your credit or debit card may be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time Your Trial first began. Trial Premiums are not available to former Users of Premium Services or Users who have previously received a free trial and cancelled it prior to paying for Premium Services.
Purchases.  We reserve the right to correct errors (whether by changing information on the BarBee Services or by informing You of the error and giving You an opportunity to cancel Your order) or to update information at any time without notice. We may grant or deny cancellation requests for individual orders in Our sole and absolute discretion. All sales are final.
Promo Codes.  BarBee may, from time to time in its sole discretion, offer certain promotional codes for discounts. Promotional codes are non-transferable and are not redeemable for cash, credit, or toward previous purchases. There is no cash alternative. Furthermore, promotional codes cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or promotional discount, and must be redeemed by the date published, if provided. Lost promotional codes cannot be replaced. Limit one promotional code per customer. Promotional codes are void where prohibited. Any promotional program may be terminated or modified by BarBee at any time in Our sole discretion.
Payments Are Non-Refundable.  Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement (including Section 24 where You are a resident in certain states in the United States and the Special Terms where You are a resident of certain countries), any and all payments made to BarBee are final and all charges are nonrefundable. Cancellations are effective the following billing period in which payment is due, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.
Taxes. Unless specified otherwise at the time of purchase, all payments to BarBee are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and You are responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.
Microtransactions. From time to time, You may be able to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to certain add-on features for use solely in the BarBee Services (collectively, “Microtransactions”). BarBee reserves the right to charge fees, in its sole discretion, for the right to access or use add-on features and/or may distribute add-on features with or without charge. BarBee may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Microtransactions and/or add-on features at any time. Any add-on feature balance shown in Your User Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license. Add-on features do not incur fees for non-use; however, the license granted to You from Microtransactions will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement when We cease providing the BarBee Services or Your User Account is otherwise closed or terminated. BarBee shall have no liability to You or any third party in the event that BarBee exercises any such rights. The provision of add-on features for use in the BarBee Services is a service that commences immediately upon the acceptance of such Microtransactions. ALL MICROTRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE BARBEE SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BARBEE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED ADD-ON FEATURES WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
YOUR USAGE.
You acknowledge that some of the BarBee Services may only be accessed by downloading the BarBee Software to a mobile device. You will not have the opportunity to view Your User Content (including chat) unless You have downloaded the BarBee Software and registered an account.
BARBEE RESERVES THE RIGHT, BUT HAS NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR ANY USER’S USE OF THE BARBEE SERVICES, INCLUDING A USER’S REGISTRATION OR MESSAGING, AS WELL AS A USER’S USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE LOCATION INFORMATION AND PROFILES OF OTHER USERS. ACCORDINGLY, BARBEE ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO (A) DISABLE ANY USER’S USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE BARBEE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE LOCATION INFORMATION OR PROFILES OF OTHER USERS OR (B) TERMINATE ANY USER’S ACCOUNT, FOR ANY REASON AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE OR OUR BEING LIABLE TO YOU. REFUNDS WILL ONLY BE GIVEN WHERE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
You alone are responsible for Your involvement with other Users and for all content and material that You provide to the BarBee Services. You agree that BarBee will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. BarBee reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disagreements between You and other Users.
BarBee does not control the content of User Accounts and profiles. BarBee has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor such content for any purpose. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for all content and material that You provide to the BarBee Services.
OUR REFUSAL OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR SERVICE.
You may terminate Your Account at any time for any reason, by following the instructions given in the BarBee Services. Upon the cancellation of Your account, this Agreement will immediately terminate, except as provided in Section 25.4 below.
If You have a User Account set up for recurring billing for a Premium Service, You may cancel Your User Account at any time. You will continue to have the same access for any billing period or periods for which You have paid.
BarBee may suspend or terminate any User Account You have with the BarBee Services or Your access to or use of the BarBee Services or any portion thereof, if BarBee believes that Your profile content or Your conduct within the BarBee Services violates Our Terms of Service or you have otherwise breached this Agreement, or for any other reason, in its sole discretion, subject to Sections 11.4 and 11.5 below. BarBee may also remove and discard all or any part of Your User Account or any User Content (as defined below), at any time. You agree that any termination of Your access to the BarBee Services or any User Account You may have or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice (except as provided in Section 11.4 below), and You agree that BarBee will not be liable to You or any third party for any such termination and refunds will only be given where expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section 11.5 below). For example, We may deactivate Your User Account due to prolonged inactivity. Without limitation of our other rights, We reserve the right to delete all Your User Content from the BarBee Services upon any termination or cancellation of Your User Account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of Your use of the BarBee Services may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies BarBee may have at law or in equity.
If you have paid for a Premium Service, BarBee will give you at least 30 days’ notice of termination of Your access to the BarBee Services or any User Account unless Your profile content or Your conduct within the BarBee Services violates Our Terms of Service or You have otherwise breached this Agreement, in which case BarBee may suspend or terminate Your access to the BarBee Services or any User Account immediately.
If You have paid for a Premium Service and BarBee terminates Your access to the BarBee Services or any user Account, BarBee will give a pro-rata refund for any amounts pre-paid, but unused for such Premium Services; provided that if BarBee terminates Your access to the BarBee Services or any User Account because You have violated Our Terms of Service, BarBee will be entitled to retain the amounts that You paid for the BarBee Services. But where required by law (such as in the UK), BarBee will only retain an amount to cover all costs and other losses it incurs as a result of the violation or breach, which may still mean that no refund is payable.
You acknowledge and agree that Google, Apple, or another third-party platform provider (as applicable, based on the device and operating system You use) may be the merchant of record for transactions involving the BarBee Services. As such, you may need to request any refund to which You are entitled under this Agreement through the App Store, Google Play, or other third-party platform (as applicable).
If You believe that BarBee has suspended or terminated Your User Account in error, You may contact Us at info@barbee.app at any time.
USER CONTENT.
The BarBee Services allow the submission of content and materials (such as pictures, ideas, notes, concepts, or creative suggestions) by You and other Users to BarBee and other Users (“User Content”), and the hosting, sharing and/or publishing of such User Content with BarBee and other Users.
You are solely responsible for Your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, You represent and warrant that: (i) You own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use, and authorize BarBee to use, all intellectual property and any other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the BarBee Services and this Agreement; and (ii) You have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the BarBee Services and this Agreement. For clarity, You shall retain all of Your ownership rights in Your User Content.
You understand that when using the BarBee Services, You will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources, and that BarBee is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Content. You further understand and acknowledge that You may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable.
BarBee assumes no responsibility whatsoever in connection with or arising from User Content. BarBee assumes no responsibility for actively monitoring User Content for inappropriate content. If at any time BarBee chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor User Content, BarBee nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the content of the User Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate User Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting User Content. Further, BarBee does not endorse and has no control over the content of User Content submitted by other Users. BarBee makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the content of User Content or the accuracy and reliability of any User Content. Nonetheless, BarBee reserves the right to prevent You from submitting User Content and to edit, restrict or remove User Content for any reason at any time.
User Content is owned by the User who submitted it, subject to BarBee’s license to such User Content under this Agreement. You may not share, display or duplicate the User Content of any other party, except as permitted under this Agreement.
You hereby grant, and You represent and warrant that You have the right to grant, to BarBee an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit Your User Content, (through unlimited tiers of sublicenses), solely for the purposes of including Your User Content in the BarBee Services and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your User Content. You also hereby grant to BarBee, in connection with a sale of BarBee or the assets of BarBee, the right to sell or transfer the User Content to a third party. Please see Our Privacy Policy for additional information about the use, collection, or sharing of Your information, including User Content.
If You provide BarBee with any feedback or suggestions regarding the BarBee Services (“Feedback”), You hereby grant BarBee the perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate. BarBee will treat any Feedback You provide to BarBee as non-confidential and non-proprietary to You. BarBee will have no obligation under any circumstances to compensate You for any Feedback. You agree that You will not submit to BarBee any information or ideas that You consider to be confidential or proprietary, or for which You expect to be compensated.
THIRD-PARTY SITES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; LINKS.

RESOLVING OUR DISPUTES; AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.  You and BarBee agree that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to Your use of or access to the BarBee Services, any validity, interpretation, breach, enforcement, or termination of this Agreement, or otherwise relating to BarBee in any way (collectively, “Covered Dispute Matters”) will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 21.
Informal Resolution. If You have any dispute with Us, You and We agree that before taking any formal action, You will contact Us at info@barbee.app, provide a brief, written description of the dispute and Your contact information (including Your email address associated with Your User Account, if Your dispute relates to an account) and allow sixty (60) days to pass, during which We will attempt to reach an amicable resolution of any issue with You.
Applicable Law.  You and We agree that United States federal law including the Federal Arbitration Act, and (to the extent not inconsistent with or pre-empted by federal law) the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles, will govern all Covered Dispute Matters, except as may be expressly provided in the Special Terms.
Our Arbitration. You and We agree that this Agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Dispute Matter must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (including utilizing desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel). You and We agree that the arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. You and We agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, international, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject to arbitration. You and We agree that judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The Arbitrator’s Award to You or Us.  You and We agree that for matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same BarBee User to the extent required by applicable law. You and We agree that the arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 21.6 below, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by You or BarBee and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that You or BarBee have sought public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration after the party seeking public injunctive relief has first prevailed in arbitration. The parties agree that the litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
Exceptions To Our Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes.  There are only two exceptions to this agreement to arbitrate:
First, if either party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner violated or threatened to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party whose rights have been violated may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Second, each party will retain the right to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the jurisdiction of such courts.
Who Bears the Costs of Arbitration.  You and We agree that payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate.
Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You and We agree that if We make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against BarBee prior to the effective date of the amendment. However, the amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between You and BarBee. If You do not agree to these amended terms, You may close Your account within thirty (30) days of the posting or notification and You will not be bound by the amended terms.
Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.  Unless You and We agree otherwise and except as described in Section 21.6.2 (Small Claims Court), in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to You or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of Your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, or because You are an international user to which this agreement to arbitrate does not apply, You agree (except as otherwise provided by law) that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and BarBee must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Los Angeles County, California. You and BarBee agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION.  IF YOU ARE A NEW BARBEE USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION (“OPT-OUT”) BY EMAILING US AN OPT-OUT NOTICE TO INFO@BARBEE.APP (“OPT-OUT NOTICE”) OR REGULAR MAIL TO: BarBee Inc, PO Box 69176, West Hollywood, CA 90069.

If You opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of this Agreement and this Disputes Section (including Sections 19 (You Acknowledge the Benefit of the Bargain with BarBee) and 14 through 18 (14 -Advertising; 15 – End User Licenses; 16 – Our Disclaimers; No Warranties to You, 17 – Your Indemnification of Us; You Hold BarBee Harmless, and 18 – Limitation of our Liability and of Your Damages)) will continue to apply to You. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that You may have with Us.
YOU WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS.  BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE (i) TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE), (ii) TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES, EVEN IF ARBITRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND (iii) TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR YOUR CLAIMS. REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SITE, SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

Special Terms for International Users
UNITED KINGDOM. The following terms apply to You, and supersede conflicting terms in this Agreement, if You are a UK resident to the extent required by applicable law:
Cancellation within 14-day cancellation period.  You have the right to cancel Your BarBee Premium Services within fourteen (14) days without giving any reason. The cancellation period will expire after fourteen (14) days from Your purchase of the BarBee Premium Services. If You have benefitted from a free trial, the cancellation period will expire fourteen (14) days from the beginning of Your free trial. To exercise the right to cancel Your BarBee Premium Services during the fourteen (14) day cancellation period, You must inform Us at info@barbee.app of Your decision to cancel by a clear statement. You may use the Model Withdrawal Form found in Annex I(B) of the Directive on Consumer Rights. We will communicate to You an acknowledgment of receipt of such cancellation by email without delay. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for You to send Your communication concerning Your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired. There are no separate cancellation fees but there are no refunds except as provided herein. We will refund You a pro-rata amount of the Premium fee for the unused period of Your Premium Services. You will still be required to pay a Premium Service fee for the period of Your Premium Services until You communicated to Us Your cancellation, (excluding any free trial period where no payment was taken) and We will therefore not refund You for that portion of Your Premium Services. We will make the refund without undue delay and not later than fourteen (14) days after the day on which We are informed about Your decision to cancel Your Premium Services. We will issue the refund using the same means of payment as You used for the initial transaction, unless You have expressly agreed otherwise.

You and We are aware that Brazilian law does not allow indemnification for indirect damages, but solely the effective losses and the loss of profits directly and immediately caused by it.
Statute of Limitations for Your Claims. The provisions of this Agreement related to statute of limitations may not apply to You, if the applicable Brazilian law establishes a different or specific statute of limitations for a certain claim. In this case, You will be subject to the specific statute of limitations stipulated under the applicable Brazilian law.
